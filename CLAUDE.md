# Project Instructions for AI Agents

This file provides instructions and context for AI coding agents working on this project.

<!-- BEGIN KARPATHY GUIDELINES v:1 -->
## Behavioral Guidelines (Karpathy-Inspired)

These guidelines reduce common LLM coding mistakes. For trivial tasks (typos, one-liners), use judgment - not every change needs full rigor.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Forgejo Issue Tracker

This project uses **Forgejo** for issue tracking, repos, and CI. Forgejo runs at `https://forgejo.paradigm.local`. `forgejo-eventbus` provides sync between Forgejo issues and Crumbs kanban — the single pane of glass for human project management.

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Forgejo web UI: http://127.0.0.1:3000/hal
# Crumbs kanban: https://kanban.paradigm.local
# Clone with embedded token:
git clone https://<token>@127.0.0.1:3000/hal/<repo>.git
```

### Rules

- All issues, projects, and tasks are tracked in Forgejo (source of truth for code/dev projects)
- Crumbs is the visual kanban layer, synced via forgejo-eventbus
- Use `tea` CLI or Forgejo web UI for issue operations
- Do NOT use markdown TODO lists for task tracking

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues on Forgejo (`http://127.0.0.1:3000/hal`)
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items in Forgejo
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
